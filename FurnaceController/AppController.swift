/*
 AppController is the brains behind the furnace controller app. It handles both timers used, tells the arduino when to poll for data, handles graphing and saving the sensor data, and has the main logic for starting and stopping recording. It is a singleton class because we were having some issues getting sensor data from the ArduinoController back to the AppController after polling.

/// This class contains both of the timers that are used in the FurnaceController application: one for displaying on the GUI and the other for determining when the sensors are polled. To poll the sensors, AppController communicates with ArduinoController. The data received is then communicated to GraphController and DataController to update the graph and CSV, respectively.
